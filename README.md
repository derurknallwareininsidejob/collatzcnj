This small repository contains some testing towards the infamous **3n+1 problem**,
even though countless mathematicians have already failed to prove or disprove the problem.
It is commonly called the **Collatz Conjecture**.

## --- definition Collatz Conjecture ---
Take the term n which is a natural number. If the term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, then it repeats.
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

I am just having fun while learning a little bit of python and enjoying math, fully knowing that this is not solveable.
