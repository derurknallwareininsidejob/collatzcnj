# collatzcnj.py

This small repository contains my testing towards the infamous **3n+1 problem**,
even though countless mathematicians have already failed to prove or disprove the problem.
It is commonly called the **Collatz Conjecture**.

### definition
if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.


I am just having fun while learning a little bit of python and enjoying math.
